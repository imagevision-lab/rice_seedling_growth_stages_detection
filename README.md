# rice_seedling_growth_stages_detection

This repository contains the code and results in context of the paper titled **Machine Learning Approaches for Rice Seedling Growth Stages Detection**

### Organisation of code

The code for all the experiment configurations is arranged in directory structures across two different levels.

The first layer is divided into a selection based on HOG-SVM and Deep Learning networks, which is divided into :

- Deep Learning

- HOG-SVM

In each folder, the second layer is based on the choice of different networks. The available options are:

- vgg16_224
- res50_224
- des121_224
- effb0_224
- effb1_240
- effb2_260
- effb3_300
- effb4_380
- effb4_380_1000
- effb4_380_2000
- effb4_380_3000
- effb5_456
- effb6_528
- effb7_600
